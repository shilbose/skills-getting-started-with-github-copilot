# 4-Gram Extraction App - Project Summary

## ✅ Project Completed Successfully!

I've built a comprehensive 4-gram extraction application that finds all sequences of 4 consecutive words from input sentences.

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Application Files:
1. **`fourgram_app.py`** - Main web application using FastAPI
2. **`templates/index.html`** - Beautiful, responsive web interface
3. **`fourgram_cli.py`** - Command-line version of the tool
4. **`fourgram_requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
5. **`FOURGRAM_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 How to Run

### Web Application:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r fourgram_requirements.txt

# Start the web app
python3 fourgram_app.py

# Access at: http://localhost:8000
```

### Command Line Tool:
```bash
# Basic usage
python3 fourgram_cli.py "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

# JSON output
python3 fourgram_cli.py -f json "Your sentence here"

# Interactive mode
python3 fourgram_cli.py --interactive

# From stdin
echo "Your sentence" | python3 fourgram_cli.py --stdin
```

## ✨ Features

### Web Interface:
- 🎨 Modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds
- 📊 Real-time statistics (word count, total 4-grams, unique 4-grams)
- 🔍 Visual display of all 4-grams found
- 📈 Frequency analysis for repeated 4-grams
- 💡 Built-in example sentences
- 🚀 Fast, real-time processing

### CLI Tool:
- 📝 Text and JSON output formats
- 🔄 Interactive mode for multiple sentences
- 📥 Stdin support for piping text
- 📊 Detailed statistics and frequency analysis
- 🎯 Clean, emoji-enhanced output

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /extract` - Form submission endpoint
- `GET /api/extract/{sentence}` - REST API (GET)
- `POST /api/extract` - REST API (POST with JSON)
- `GET /health` - Health check

## 🧪 Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

1. ✅ **Basic extraction**: "The quick brown fox..." → 6 4-grams
2. ✅ **JSON output**: Proper JSON formatting
3. ✅ **Frequency analysis**: Correctly identifies repeated 4-grams
4. ✅ **Short sentences**: Handles < 4 words gracefully
5. ✅ **Web server**: Starts successfully on port 8000
6. ✅ **Text processing**: Cleans punctuation and normalizes text

## 📊 Example Output

**Input**: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

**4-grams found**:
1. "the quick brown fox"
2. "quick brown fox jumps"
3. "brown fox jumps over"
4. "fox jumps over the"
5. "jumps over the lazy"
6. "over the lazy dog"

**Statistics**: 9 words → 6 total 4-grams → 6 unique 4-grams

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Text Processing**: Automatic cleaning (lowercase, punctuation removal, whitespace normalization)
- **Algorithm**: Sliding window approach for efficient 4-gram extraction
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templating
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Educational**: Learning about n-grams and text analysis
- **Research**: Analyzing text patterns in documents
- **Development**: Integrating into larger NLP pipelines
- **Content Analysis**: Identifying repeated phrases
- **Language Learning**: Studying word patterns

## 💡 What Are 4-Grams?

4-grams (quadrigrams) are sequences of 4 consecutive words used in:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text analysis and linguistics
- Language modeling
- Plagiarism detection
- Text similarity analysis

The application successfully extracts all possible 4-gram sequences from any input sentence, providing valuable insights into text structure and patterns.
